# FractalAttackOnline
An online version of Fractal Attack.

This is a low bandwidth implementation that attempts to setup the same initial game state at the same epoch across all clients using a pseudo random generator for a deterministic simulation.

This means that players only need to transmit their position. Players don't have a facing direction, but if they did I would infer it from their last position and their new position.
