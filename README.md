# FractalAttackOnline
An online version of Fractal Attack.

This is a low bandwidth implementation that attempts to setup the same initial game state at the same epoch across all clients using a custom pseudo random generator for a deterministic simulation.

This means that players only need to transmit their position. Players don't have a facing direction, but if they did I would infer it from their last position and their new position.

The Asteroids move quite slowly so being even a second or two out of sync would not be that bad, but reducing the speed even more compensates for higher deviations between clients.

Here's the fun part, it's a make your own server game *(for now)*. It's not that hard, have fun!

#### Server
Server should only track 8 player positions per game id.

- **Register** (?r=<game id>)
  
Registration ID is the unix epoch of when the game starts, after this epoch passes no more registrations should be accepted. The server should assign each registration it's uniqued index from 0-7 and save its registration ID, preferably as session data.
- **Position** (?p=%00%00%00%00%01%01%01%01%02%02%02%02)
  
When each player submits a position they will do so via this parameter as bytecode provided as escaped hex in the url parameter, it will be 3 floats of 4 bytes each. The server should then respond with an array of 7 player positions all of the same game id excluding your own position.
